Hi there! My name is Cassian Johnston, and I love telling stories and learning about digital culture. I enjoy exploring how the internet affects our ability to connect, communicate, and find humor in day-to-day situations.

You can probably find me browsing social media, keeping up with the newest trends, or trying out artistic endeavors that combine technology and culture when I'm not writing.

I use this blog as a place to share my thoughts, observations, and anecdotes about the rapidly evolving realm of online culture. I appreciate you coming by, and I can't wait to have you join me!
